#My Story Squeeze

##My Story Squeeze is an idea that people might want to connect with someone else at a deeper level than that of just quick posts and pictures.

##That's where __Story Squeeze__ comes into play.

###My idea for __Story Squeeze__ is as follows:

* Register as a user through Facebook or possibly another dating website.
* Search for others using geographic locators (It can be romantic, friendly or a way of practicing another language and meeting someone from abroad).
* Choose a story style (Horror, Romance, Drama)
* Choose a story mode  (Thoughtful or Quick mode)
* Read past stories from users, who can opt to stay anonymous until you invite them to be friends.
